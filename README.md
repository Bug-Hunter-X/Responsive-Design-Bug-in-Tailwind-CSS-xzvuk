# Responsive Design Bug in Tailwind CSS

This repository contains a bug report and solution for a responsive design issue in Tailwind CSS. The bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design on mobile devices. The solution involves adding custom CSS rules to override Tailwind's default behavior.

## Bug

The bug is that the responsive design does not work properly on mobile devices. The problem occurs when using Tailwind CSS classes for responsive design, such as `md:px-4` or `lg:w-1/2`. On mobile devices, these classes are not applied correctly, which causes the layout to break.

## Solution

The solution is to add custom CSS rules to override Tailwind's default behavior. This can be done by adding a new CSS file to your project and including it in your HTML file. The CSS file should contain rules that apply the correct styles to mobile devices.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Create a new project using Tailwind CSS.
2. Add some Tailwind CSS classes to your HTML elements.
3. View the project on a mobile device.
4. Observe that the responsive design does not work properly.

## Solution Steps

1. Add a new CSS file to your project, named style.css.
2. Add custom CSS rules to the style.css file to override Tailwind's default behavior for mobile devices.
3. Include the style.css file in your HTML file.
4. Refresh the page on a mobile device.
5. Observe that the responsive design now works properly.
